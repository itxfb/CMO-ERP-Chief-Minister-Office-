# Chief Minister Office ERP System

The Chief Minister Office ERP System is a powerful and efficient platform built to streamline the operations and enhance the functionality of the Chief Minister's office. Leveraging Angular and .NET technologies, this system encompasses dynamic control permissions, follows the CQRS pattern with handlers, utilizes the Generic Unit of Work, and embraces Inversion of Control concepts. With JWT token-based authentication on the .NET side and advanced Angular features such as AuthGuard, Interceptors, Directives, and Reactive Forms, this ERP system sets new standards in performance optimization and code simplicity.

## Key Features and Technologies

- **Angular and .NET Integration**: Seamlessly integrates Angular and .NET for a robust and efficient ERP system.

- **Dynamic Control Permissions**: Implements dynamic control permissions, ensuring access to specific features and functionalities based on user roles.

- **CQRS Pattern with Handlers**: Adopts the CQRS pattern with handlers, allowing for efficient command and query separation for improved maintainability.

- **Generic Unit of Work**: Utilizes the Generic Unit of Work pattern for effective data management and interaction with the database.

- **Inversion of Control (IoC) Concepts**: Employs IoC concepts to enhance code modularity, maintainability, and testability.

- **JWT Token-Based Authentication (Backend)**: Implements JWT token-based authentication on the .NET side, ensuring secure user authentication and authorization.

- **Angular Features (AuthGuard, Interceptors, Directives, Reactive Forms)**: Utilizes Angular's AuthGuard for route protection, Interceptors for global HTTP request handling, Directives for reusable UI components, and Reactive Forms for streamlined data-driven forms.

- **Reusable Components ("Call When Required" Concept)**: Maximizes performance and minimizes code complexity by creating generic and reusable components using a "call when required" approach.
